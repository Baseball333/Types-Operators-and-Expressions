# Types-Operators-and-Expressions
This is the next chapter in "the C Programming Language" which extends the scope of C and provides mathematical depth to such an otherwise syntactically simple language

First Commit:
This repository is the next chapter of the fundamental text which describes the mentioned constructs. Variables and constructs are considered the basic data types
within a program. Operators describe the computational aspects of a data type, whilst expressions combine variables and constants to produce new values. The type
of an object describes its sets of values and operations. This is considered the basis of C since its inception in 1972.

Second Commit:
The next commit will describe the semantics of naming variables.
